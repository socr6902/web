    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Pottery</h2>
    <p>Aside from the obvious fact that pottery is one of the oldest forms of art, it is also my favorite hobby. It can be beautiful, functional, or both, and the process involves a lot of design and preparation. I'll walk you through it.</p>
    
    <h2 id="process">The Process</h2>
    <h3 id="clay-preparation">Preparation of Clay</h3>
    <p>This is the boring part. For my kind of pottery, wheel throwing, preparation involves cutting off a chunk of clay (usually weighing it), and completing a process called wedging. This process is essentially kneading the clay to ensure there are no air bubbles (as this would cause a potential explosion in the kiln) and aligning the clay particles in the same direction. Usually, you want to wedge at least 30 times, often longer depending on the size of the clay. It's a necessary part of the process, but it makes my arms really tired.</p>

    <h3 id="shaping-techniques">Shaping Techniques</h3>
    <p>There are several methods to shape pottery, like wheel throwing, hand-building, and slip casting. Each technique is very different. I find hand-building boring and difficult. I only do wheel throwing. This is the method that you saw in the movie *Ghost* (1990).</p>

    <h3 id="firing-glazing">Firing and Glazing</h3>
    <p>Firing hardens the clay, while glazing adds color and protection. There are different methods to firing and different kilns. This is fun because you get to add color to your piece and make it functional, but it's sad because clay shrinks a lot in the kiln, so the pot you thought was really big looks very average-sized coming out of the kiln.</p>

    <h2 id="tools">Pottery Tools and Equipment</h2>
    <p>Common tools include potterâ€™s wheels, carving tools, kilns, and glazes. All of these go into making a single piece. It's all very expensive.</p>
